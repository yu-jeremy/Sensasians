		</div>
		
		<p class="text-white">As we look ahead to the coming school year, we invite you to join the fun by signing up for your own audition! Whether you are a member of BTS (maybe not the dancing part), an experienced member of your high school choir, or someone who thinks they can't sing, we encourage you to put yourself out there, show your love for music, and get a taste of what the Sensasians are all about. Yes, we are an Asian-interest a cappella group; that does not mean we sing only Asian music and you certainly don't have to be Asian to audition and join. That does mean we come together to make music with open minds and respect for cultures that are not our own.</p>

		<p class="text-white">Most importantly, we want you to see this as an opportunity to express a part of who you are. We all went through the auditions process ourselves so we understand what being nervous and hesitant feels like. We'll support you the whole way through and you'll also get to know us a bit! If nothing else, this is an opportunity to meet some new faces as you become a part of the WashU community! </p>

		<p id="arrival-note" class="text-black"><strong>Please note that we will have you fill out a short questionnaire before your audition, so please plan accordingly by arriving 5-10 minutes before your official time slot. Here's some more important information you should know about how auditions will be happening.</strong>

			<ol id="auditions_info">
				<li><strong>When will auditions be taking place?</strong>
					<p class="text-white">We'll be holding first-round auditions from Friday, August 30th to Sunday, September 1st. 15-minute slots are available on the 30th from 6PM to 10PM, from 11AM to 10PM on the 31st, and from 11AM to 9PM on the 1st. Stayed tuned for more information about callback auditions!</p>
				</li>

				<li><strong>Where will auditions be held?</strong>
					<p class="text-white">The location of your audition depends on which day you schedule your audition! Here is a short 
						list of day-location pairings. If you can't find us on the day of your audition, please text us at 
						<span id="contact_num">314-366-0526!</span> Maps across WashU's campus (and on the South 40) can 
						also be a useful resource if you are in a hurry!
					</p>
					<ul class="text-white">
						<li>August 30th: Danforth Classroom A (South 40)</li>
						<li>August 31st: DUC 276</li>
						<li>September 1st: DUC 236</li> 
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br>

				<li><strong>Who should I contact in case of an emergency (i.e. can't find auditions room, generally lost)?</strong>
					<p class="text-white">Email us at any time at <a class="text-white email" href="mailto:asiacappella@gmail.com">asiacappella@gmail.com</a> or text/call us at 314-366-0526. 
					</p>
				</li>
				<li><strong>So...how do auditions work?</strong>
					<p class="text-white">Auditions will be happening in two stages. Note that the booking page that 
						is currently active lists time slots for just the first round of auditions. In this first round, 
						you should prepare a verse and chorus from a song that you think showcases your voice! 
						Or if you're anything like me (Hi!), go through your Spotify playlist and choose one of 
						your favorite songs! This basically means you should prepare a a snippet of a solo for us to hear. 
						Our music director(s) will be there to guide you through the other parts of the first round audition. 
						While this first round is open to anyone, callbacks will be scheduled with only a portion of all 
						first-round auditionees after some initial cuts are made. During this round, which immediately 
						follows the first weekend of auditions, you should prepare another short solo for us to hear 
						(i.e. think about choosing a song that contrasts your solo from the first round). </p>
				</li>

				<li><strong>Do I have to sign up before school or will there be chances to book a time slot when I come to campus?</strong>
					<p class="text-white">The booking page is live now so feel free to schedule your audition now! 
						Typically, auditionees wait until they've had an opportunity to hear the groups sing, which 
						will occur at certain events during your first week on campus. These events include the ACAC 
						A Cappella Showcase (Tuesday, August 27th from 7-9:30PM at Graham Chapel) and dorm storming during the week of school. 
						This last event will bring each group right to your dorm for a brief showcase! You'll get a 
						chance to sign up after such performances.
					</p>
				</li>

				<li><strong>How long will an audition be?</strong>
					<p class="text-white">Your first round audition with us will last around 15 minutes. Callback auditions typically last around 30 minutes. It is best if you arrive 10 minutes early for both occasions.</p>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Do I need to be Asian to become a Sensasian?</strong>
					<span class="text-white">No! Even if you have no interest in singing Asian music and are not ethnically Asian, we encourage you to audition! All of our current members came to WashU with different levels of interest in the group's music and the group itself and we are not equally interested in Asian music/culture right now! We like to think of it this way: anyone who auditions for us and becomes a part of our family contributes to the group's idenity. We invite you to add another layer to what it means to be a Sensasian and want to encourage you to expand your horizons if something like this is outside of your comfort zone!</span>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p class="text-white">So, as the school year bears down on us (ha, WashU bears), check out some of our music on Spotify (see new album), watch our concert videos on Youtube, or even reach out to us with any questions at the email listed above!</p>
